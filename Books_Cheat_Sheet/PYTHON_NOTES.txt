PYTHON NOTES:

### Error handling with try-except
Exceptions = error handling while code execution

A good practice in writing your own functions is also anticipating the ways in which 
other people (or yourself, if you accidentally misuse your own function) 
might use the function you defined.

- One way of doing this is through exception handling with the try-except block.

	try:
        [code]
    except:
		[code]
		
		
- Another way to raise an error is by using raise.
	if x < 0:
		raise [Exception]('Message')
